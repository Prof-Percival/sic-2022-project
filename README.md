# sic-2022-project
**Samsung Innovation Campus** Coding &amp; Programming in Python: **Mini Project**

This project focuses on analysis of **Crime, Unemployment, & Poverty.** 
The sic-project-final file contains the code that was used to analyse data whic was downloaded from South African Police Service **(SAPS)**, and it was then sorted, analysed the crimes, grouped the crimes by category and visualized them.

The question was:
**'What can we do with the major challenges facing South Africa from technology perspective?'**

Identified the major challenges as: <br>
**1. Unemployment** <br>
**2. Poverty** <br>
**3. GBV, Rapes, Murders (CRIME)**

A lot of ideas came through, which resulted in a big system that could tackle the issues, and the proposed System (Citizen Identifier) was presented to the judges.
